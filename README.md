Contactzilla Sync Client App
=====================

Please see the [Contactzilla website](https://contactzilla.com) for
detailed information about the software.

The software is a CardDAV client forked from PeopleSync which is forked from DAVx⁵. This product has been amended to work better for our product when provisioned with MDM solutions. For the personal usage of CardDAV and CalDAV we recommend to use the [DAVx⁵](https://www.davx5.com) app with more configuration options.


The Contactzilla Sync client app is licensed under the [GPLv3 License](LICENSE).

The Contactzilla server software is a [cloud based CardDAV solution for businesses](https://contactzilla.com) and is proprietary commercial software.


The Contactzilla Sync client app is based on [PeopleSync](https://www.messageconcept.com/en/products/peoplesync/) which is based on [DAVx⁵](https://www.davx5.com) and parts of DAVx⁵ have been outsourced into these libraries:

* [cert4android](https://github.com/bitfireAT/cert4android) – custom certificate management
* [dav4jvm](https://github.com/bitfireAT/dav4jvm) – WebDAV/CalDav/CardDAV framework
